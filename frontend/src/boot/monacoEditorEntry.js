/*
  A trimmed stand-in for the `monaco-editor` package's own entry point (`esm/vs/index.js`, what
  `import ... from 'monaco-editor'` resolves to) -- `vite.config.js`'s `resolve.alias` redirects the
  bare `'monaco-editor'` specifier here for every real build/dev bundle, so every call site keeps
  writing `import * as monaco from 'monaco-editor'` completely unchanged. The alias is exact-match
  only, so a DEEP specifier such as `boot/monaco.js`'s own `monaco-editor/language/json/json.worker
  ?worker` is untouched and still resolves into the real package as before. `vitest.config.js`
  deliberately carries no such alias, so every existing `vi.mock('monaco-editor', ...)` in the test
  suite keeps intercepting the bare specifier exactly as it always has -- this file is only ever
  reached by a real Vite build or the dev server.

  WHY THIS EXISTS (OpenProject #3171): `monaco-editor`'s own entry point imports ALL FOUR advanced
  language "features" unconditionally -- css, html, json and typescript -- and each one's own
  `workerManager.js` carries a `new Worker(new URL('xxx.worker.js', import.meta.url))` call that
  Vite's built-in worker plugin bundles into `assets/` purely from STATIC analysis of the reachable
  module graph, regardless of whether that worker's constructor is ever actually called at runtime.
  That is what put `ts.worker` (6.9 MB) and `css.worker` (1.05 MB) into the build: nothing in this
  codebase ever creates a Monaco model with `language: 'css'`/`'scss'`/`'less'` or
  `'typescript'`/`'javascript'` (the full inventory is on the work package's implementation-plan
  comment) -- every surface here uses `markdown`, `html`, `json` or `plaintext` -- so trimming
  `boot/monaco.js`'s `getWorker` map alone (done in the same commit as this file) could not remove
  either chunk: the workers were never reachable through our OWN code, only through monaco's.

  This file is every line of `monaco-editor@0.56.0`'s `esm/vs/index.js`, generated with
  `/private/tmp/.../gen-monaco-entry.mjs` (not committed -- a throwaway one-off script) rather than
  transcribed by hand, with exactly three kinds of change:
    1. The `css` and `typescript` language FEATURE imports (and their re-exports) are dropped --
       the two lines each that carry the worker-bundling code above. Regenerate this file with the
       same script (minus those two `dropMarkers` entries) if a future editor surface genuinely
       needs TypeScript or CSS language services -- deliberately, not by hand-editing this file.
    2. Every remaining `./x` relative import becomes a deep `monaco-editor/x` specifier, dropping
       the `esm/vs/` prefix -- `boot/monaco.js`'s own header comment documents why: the package's
       `"./*.js": "./esm/vs/*.js"` exports-map entry would double that prefix otherwise.
    3. The two `.css` imports (codicon glyphs, still needed -- monaco's own UI chrome, hover/suggest/
       quick-access icons included, draws from them) don't end in `.js`, so they fall through to the
       exports map's generic `"./*": "./esm/vs/*.js"` fallback, which would wrongly append a literal
       `.js` AFTER the `.css` extension. They go in as a plain relative path straight into this
       workspace's own `node_modules` instead, which bypasses the exports map entirely (a relative
       specifier resolves as an ordinary file path, never subject to package-exports encapsulation) --
       exactly how `index.js` itself reaches them today, unremarked, because it never leaves the
       package. Safe here specifically because every workspace in this repo is independently
       installed with its own `node_modules` (root `CLAUDE.md`) -- there is no hoisting to account
       for.
    4. The one import this file does NOT carry at all: `index.js`'s own first two lines import and
       re-export `../external/monaco-lsp-client/out/index.js` as `monaco.lsp`. That path lives
       outside `esm/vs/`, so it cannot be reached at all through the public exports map (mirroring
       point 3 above) -- and nothing in this codebase reads `monaco.lsp`, so it is dropped rather
       than worked around.
