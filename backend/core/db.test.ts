/**
 * Task 708 (feature 411): confirms what `core/db.ts`'s `subscribeToNotifications()` /
 * `notifyViaDB()` actually guarantee for a cross-instance event relayed over the `wiki` NOTIFY
 * channel, and whether any current subscriber (`core/config.ts`'s `reloadConfig`,
 * `core/maintenance.ts`'s `disconnectWebsockets`/`flushCaches`, and — added by OpenProject #966 —
 * `models/groups.ts`/`sites.ts`/`approvals.ts`'s `reloadGroups`/`reloadSites`/`reloadApprovals`)
 * depends on more than that.
 *
 * Postgres NOTIFY has no persistence and no delivery guarantee: a message published while nobody
 * is LISTENing on that channel is dropped by the server, not queued for later delivery. `notifier`
 * (`helpers/pubsub.ts`'s `createNotifier`, wired here as the module-scoped `notifier` in `db.ts`)
 * mirrors that faithfully on the sending side — it reads the live client fresh on every send and
 * does nothing (no throw, no buffering) when there isn't one. Test 1 below exercises exactly that
 * condition: `WIKI.dbManager.pubsubClient` being `null`, which is the real state both while the
 * only other instance is down and during this instance's own listener reconnect window
 * (`helpers/pubsub.ts`'s `connectListener`, task 703) after a dropped connection and before the
 * next one lands.
 *
 * A fake `Pool`/`PoolClient` pair stands in for postgres, matching `helpers/pubsub.test.ts`'s
 * fixtures — this is event-bus wiring and delivery-loss semantics, not SQL, so a mock is the right
 * tool per CLAUDE.md's testing guidance rather than a real two-`node backend` harness (also not
 * available in this environment; see `dev/multi-instance-verify/README.md` §8 for what that would
 * look like and why it is not needed to settle this question).
 *
 * **Finding**, expanded on in `dev/multi-instance-verify/README.md`: no subscriber is exposed to a
 * *permanently* missed event, because `index.ts`'s `preBoot()` calls `configSvc.loadFromDb()` and
 * `postBoot()` calls `groups`/`sites`/`locales`/`approvals` `.reloadCache()` unconditionally on
 * every boot — not gated on any notification ever having arrived. An instance that missed a
 * `reloadConfig`/`flushCaches`/`reloadGroups`/`reloadSites`/`reloadApprovals` notify while it was
 * down (or mid-restart) is fully resynced the moment it comes back, regardless of what it missed. The
 * narrower residual gap is an instance that stays up throughout but loses one specific
 * notification during its own listener's brief reconnect window: nothing re-checks the DB for it
 * independently until the next matching event (another settings save, another manual "flush
 * caches" click) or its own next restart. That gap is judged low-severity and left undocumented in
 * code only via the comments here and in `helpers/pubsub.ts` and `core/db.ts`, rather than closed
 * with a new interval poller — see the README for the full reasoning.

/**
 * Task 2249: `init()`'s `new Pool({...})` now carries an explicit `max`, `connectionTimeoutMillis`
 * and (via the `options` connection string, alongside `search_path`) `statement_timeout`, all sourced
 * from `WIKI.config.pool` (defaulted in `base.yml`, operator-tunable via `config.yml`). Unset, pg-pool
 * falls back to `max: 10` with no connect or statement bound at all, so a saturated pool or a runaway
 * query blocks its caller forever (`docs/audit-2026-08-24/security/12-infrastructure-ops.md` §2).
 *
 * These exercise real `pg` `Pool`/Postgres behavior against the config values `db.ts#init()` now
 * passes through — a mock of `pg-pool`'s internal checkout queue or Postgres's own timeout enforcement
 * would mostly just restate what's under test rather than verify it, so this is the DB-backed
 * exception CLAUDE.md's testing guidance carves out. Gated on `DATABASE_URL` like every other
 * DB-backed suite in this file — `npm run test` reports these as skipped without one.
